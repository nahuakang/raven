# RAVEN
A toolkit for making 2D and 3D games in Odin

***WARNING: EARLY ALPHA VERSION***

Do NOT use for anything serious yet. Major features aren't fully finished and might break. There will be large breaking API changes.

Windows is most stable, WASM+WebGPU builds usually work but Linux and MacOS isn't supported yet.

## Goal
A game library made specifically for small indie teams and fast iteration times.
Something *simple* you can prototype in, but also *stable* enough to make polishing a full game straightforward.

Batteries-included toolkit for the entire code and asset pipeline.

Inspired by Sokol, PICO8 and Raylib.

## Features
- First-class 3D support
- Hotreloading by default
    - code, textures, models, even custom files
- Modular architecture
    - the `platform`, `gpu` and `audio` packages can be used independently from the Raven engine
- Minimal dependencies
    - the core of the engine is implemented fully from scratch, see `platform` and `gpu`


## Roadmap
- Finish/Rewrite Asset system
  - Scene asset pipeline
  - Blender exporter plugin/lib
- Lightweight shader transpiler
- SDL3 platform and GPU backend as a fallback
- Finish Audio system
- Better fonts
    - Draw text iterator
    - Unicode font support (currently only CP437 atlases are supported)
- Simple GUI and gizmo system
- Geometry and Collision package

## Simple Example

This is what the per-frame code could look like in a simple hello world app.

```odin
rv.set_layer_params(0, rv.make_screen_camera())

rv.bind_layer(0)
rv.bind_texture("thick")
rv.draw_text("Hello World!", {100, 100, 0})

rv.upload_gpu_layers()
rv.render_gpu_layer(0, rv.DEFAULT_RENDER_TEXTURE,
    clear_color = rv.Vec3{0, 0, 0.5} clear_depth = true)
```

To see what the entire full code looks like, check out [examples/hello](examples/hello/hello_example.odin).

## Prequisities
Install [Odin](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin) and make sure it's in your path. Check the [Official Install docs](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/) for more info.

There are no additional dependencies.

## Examples

You can run demos from the [examples/](examples) directory with something like the following command:
```
odin run examples\hello
```

Alternatively you can run them in hot-reload mode:
```
odin run build -- run_hot examples\hello
```


## Hot-reload

All assets are hotreloaded automatically, just pass `watch = true` flag when loading an asset directory.

Code can be hot reloaded by running `odin run build -- run_hot my_package`.

## Web builds

You can run the following command to export your game to web:
```
odin run build -- export_web my_package
```

To run the app locally, you must also create a tiny HTTP file server (to fetch the WASM) due to CORS policy. Something like this works:
```
python -m http.server 8000
```
And now just enter `localhost:8000` into a browser search bar.

To see the output log, open up the Developer Tools Console (F12 usually).

Please note this is still very early, the JS platform is unfinished and the WebGPU support might run into some issues.

You can also ensure WebGPU is behaving correctly locally with `odin run my_package -define:GPU_BACKEND=WGPU`, however the wgpu-native used on desktop can be slightly different than the Chrome Dawn implementation.

```


### Utils
```odin
deg(degrees: f32) -> f32                    // Convert degrees to radians
lerp(a, b: $T, t: f32) -> T                 // Linearly interpolate between A and B
lexp(a, b: $T, rate: f32) -> T              // Exponential lerp for things like 'a = lexp(a, target, delta*10)'
fade(alpha: f32) -> Vec4                    // Make a white color with a given alpha value
gray(val: f32) -> Vec4                      // Value = 0 means black, = 1 means white
vcast($T: typeid, v: [$N]$E) -> [N]T        // Cast from one type of vector to another
rot90(v: [2]$T) -> [2]T                     // Rotate a 2D vector 90 degrees counter-clockwise
unlerp(a, b: f32, x: f32) -> T              // Map x from range a..b to 0..1
remap(x, a0, a1, b0, b1: f32) -> f32        // Map x from range a0..a1 to b0..b1
smoothstep(edge0, edge1, x: f32) -> f32     // Generates a smooth curve from x in range edge0..edge1
oklerp(a, b: Vec4, t: f32) -> Vec4          // Interpolate colors with OKLAB
```
